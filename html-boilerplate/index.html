        <h3>Luella's Southern Kitchen</h3>
        <em>While chef Darnell Reed toiled in hotel kitchens in downtown Chicago, he imagined opening a restaurant that honored his great-grandmother Luella, who arrived in Chicago from Mississippi in 1943. Now, his tiny Lincoln Square restaurant serves some of the city’s best Southern food, including shrimp and grits, chicken gumbo, and a mighty platter of fried chicken and waffles. This Black-owned restaurant on the North Side is also a popular brunch destination. It’s a casual spot with counter ordering, but it brings a serious menu where everyone can find something hearty and delectable.</em>

        <h3>Community Tavern</h3>
        <strong>
            Since Joey and Brenna Beato took over Community Tavern, the Portage Park restaurant has 
            expanded its menu away from its origins as a neighborhood steakhouse. But, fortunately, the 
            neighborhood aspect remains. The bar program is robust, and kids under 12 eat free on certain days. The menu defies cohesion, which isn’t a bad thing: There’s a section of Asian-style dumplings, including one stuffed with mushroom butter. A white prawn carbonara is as much Thai as Italian, and the bibimbap can be supercharged with skirt steak, in a nod to the old steakhouse.
